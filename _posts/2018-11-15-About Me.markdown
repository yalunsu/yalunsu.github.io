Welcome! 

I currently work as a research assistant to Prof. Manasi Deshpande and her collaborators at the Kenneth C. Griffin Department of Economics, University of Chicago and Becker Friedman Institute. My broad research interests are in the field of Public and Labor Economics. In particular, I'm interested in household finance, government assistance programs, and the rising literature in intergenerational mobility and well-beings.

In my free time, I'm either sipping espresso and reading a nonfiction book, travelling ([aviation](http://flightdiary.net/yalunsu)), or learning Cantonese.
